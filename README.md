# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System

## 📌 Project Introduction

This project is developed to predict a student's performance based on different factors such as study hours, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample question papers practiced.

The project uses Machine Learning Linear Regression algorithm to estimate the Performance Index of a student.

A Flask web application is also developed so that users can enter their details and get predictions instantly.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains information about students and their academic activities.

### Input Features

1. Hours Studied
   - Number of hours spent studying.

2. Previous Scores
   - Previous academic score of the student.

3. Extracurricular Activities
   - Participation in activities.
   - Yes = 1
   - No = 0

4. Sleep Hours
   - Average sleeping hours per day.

5. Sample Question Papers Practiced
   - Number of sample papers solved.

### Target Variable

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection

The dataset is loaded from CSV file.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data/Student_Performance.csv")
```

### Step 2: Data Analysis

Data is analyzed using:

- head()
- shape
- describe()
- dtypes
- missing values

### Step 3: Data Visualization

Graphs are created using:

- Histogram
- Heatmap

This helps understand data distribution and feature relationships.

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing

Extracurricular Activities column is converted:

```python
Yes → 1
No → 0
```

Machine Learning algorithms work only with numerical values.

### Step 5: Feature Selection

Input Features:

- Hours Studied
- Previous Scores
- Extracurricular Activities
- Sleep Hours
- Sample Question Papers Practiced

Target:

- Performance Index

### Step 6: Train-Test Split

Dataset is divided into:

- 80% Training Data
- 20% Testing Data

```python
train_test_split()
```

### Step 7: Model Training

Linear Regression algorithm is used.

```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 8: Prediction

Model predicts student performance.

```python
prediction = model.predict(data)
```

### Step 9: Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics:

- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Results:

R² Score = 0.98

This indicates excellent model performance.

### Step 10: Model Saving

The trained model is saved using Pickle.

```python
pickle.dump(model, open("model.pkl","wb"))
```

## 🌐 Flask Web Application

A user-friendly web interface is developed using Flask.

Users can:

- Enter student details
- Click Predict Performance
- View predicted Performance Index
